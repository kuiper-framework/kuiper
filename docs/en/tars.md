# TARS 

[TARS](https://github.com/TarsCloud/Tars/blob/master/README.zh.md) is a high-performance RPC development framework open source by Tencent. Use the tars protocol in kuiper
The services using the JSONRPC protocol are essentially the same.

## Tars server

The TARS service currently only provides services in the TCP protocol. First configure in composer.json:

```json
{
    "extra": {
        "kuiper": {
            "configuration": [
                "kuiper\\tars\\config\\TarsServerConfiguration"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Unlike jsonrpc services, you need to create an application using `kuiper\tars\TarsApplication` in the entry file, for example:

```php
<?php

use kuiper\tars\TarsApplication;

define('APP_PATH', dirname(__DIR__));

require APP_PATH . '/vendor/autoload.php';

TarsApplication::run();
```

The service start command also needs to be modified to:

```bash
php src/index.php --config config.conf
```

This config.conf file is the template configuration file generated by the tars framework for the service.

## Service definition

The tars service is defined by [tars file](https://github.com/TarsCloud/TarsDocs/blob/master/base/tars-protocol.md).
The tars file can generate PHP code from the [tars-generator](https://github.com/wenbinye/tars-generator) command.

Because the tars framework has a service registration function, there is no need to register services with services such as consul. The middleware for service discovery has been configured in `TarsClientConfiguration`.
